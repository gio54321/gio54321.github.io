      <description>Introduction: what is Hoare logic? First steps According to wikipedia:
 Hoare logic (also known as Floydâ€“Hoare logic or Hoare rules) is a formal system with a set of logical rules for reasoning rigorously about the correctness of computer programs.
 So this is a powerful system that let us reason formally about the correctness of our program. The basic structure of Hoare logic is the Hoare triple. A triple describes how some properties of the state are modified by the execution of a program.</description>
