👋 Hello I'm Giorgio, a computer science student based in Italy, currently working to get my master’s degree.
You can find me on most sites as `gio54321` or `gio-d3141` (yes I like numbers).

I come from a pretty theoretical/formal computer science background and in the last few years, I got into security and also started playing CTFs with [Fibonhack](https://fibonhack.it).
I mainly enjoy breaking cryptography stuff, but also love tinkering with everything low-level.

In my free time, I tend to buy too many silly domains (like this one) and I experiment with ~~cursed~~ unusual programming languages, like agda, BQN, prolog, and sometimes even Java.
