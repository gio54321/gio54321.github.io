# About
ðŸ‘‹ Hello I'm Giorgio, a Computer Science student based in Italy, currently working to get my masterâ€™s degree.
I'm also working as a Cryptography Engineer / Security Researcher at [zkSecurity](https://zksecurity.xyz).
You can find me on most sites as `gio54321` or `gio-d3141` (yes I like numbers).

In my free time I like to play (and sometimes organize) CTFs together with my team [Fibonhack](https://fibonhack.it) from Pisa.
I mainly enjoy breaking cryptography stuff, but also love tinkering with anything low-level.

Other random things I enjoy:
- Playing board games.
- Buying silly domains.
- Playing the clarinet.
- Reading books, mainly non-fiction.
