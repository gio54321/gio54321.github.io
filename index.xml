      <description>Intuitionistic logic refers to a system of symbolic logic that differ from classical logic by removing the law of excluded middle (that is \(p \vee \neg p\)) and the double negation elimination (that is \(\neg \neg p \rightarrow p\)).
One of the central theorem that can be proved in intuitionistic logic, that will be our best friend in this post, is the non refutation of the law of excluded middle, which looks something like this:</description>

      <description>Introduction: what is Hoare logic? First steps According to wikipedia:
 Hoare logic (also known as Floydâ€“Hoare logic or Hoare rules) is a formal system with a set of logical rules for reasoning rigorously about the correctness of computer programs.
 So this is a powerful system that let us reason formally about the correctness of our program. The basic structure of Hoare logic is the Hoare triple. A triple describes how some properties of the state are modified by the execution of a program.</description>
